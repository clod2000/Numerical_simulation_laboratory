# Numerical_simulation_laboratory

- The Jupyter notebook are named Exercise_{number of the exercise}.
- The Random Number Generator is common for all tutorials and is located in the "generator" folder (I didn't translate the name because, naming it in all       the files, I didn't want to risk forgetting some and handing over code that doesn't work).
- For the exercises 4 and 7 the .cpp file is common and can be found in the directory MDNVE_MCNVT
